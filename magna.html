            <h4>Reflection on Goals</h4>
            <div class="my-3">
                <img src="./static/images/git.png" class="rounded my-5 goal-img" alt="Git icon">
                <p>
                    <u><b>Learn more about Git.</b></u>
                    Through the courses at the university, I've gained some pretty basic knowledge about Git
                    (cloning, pushing, committing), but I wanted to learn how to test a new feature by creating a
                    new branch and then merging it into the master branch. Through both of my projects, I was able
                    to get more comfortable with Git and used it to manage both local and remote versions of my
                    code.
                </p>
                <img src="./static/images/communication.png" class="rounded my-5 goal-img" alt="Communication icon">
                <p>
                    <u><b>Communicate concepts in a simple and effective manner.</b></u> I occasionally present
                    ideas
                    out
                    of order, making it difficult to follow my explanation.
                    This is really something I want to work on as effective communication is crucial regardless of
                    your profession. To improve my communication skills, throughout the term,
                    I focused on organizing the details in a coherent way before explaining a concept.
                    Near the end of my term, I was tasked with presenting my email tool to its
                    potential users. I created a PowerPoint presentation, drafted a script, and
                    practiced. After presenting, I was told the presentation was clear and easy to follow. I now
                    feel much more confident in my oral communication skills,
                    though I'm still far from where I'd like to be.

                <p>
                    <u><b>Learn more about MES (Manufacturing Execution Systems). </b></u>I had the opportunity to
                    learn
                    about MES from a senior manager in ERP (Enterprise Resource
                    Planning). He introduced me to various MES concepts, such as sequencing. Additionally, I spoke
                    with an MES analyst who discussed his ongoing projects to see what a career in this field might
                    look like. Prior to my co-op, I was unfamiliar with MES, but now I find it fascinating and wish
                    to delve deeper into it. It appears to be a domain that relies heavily on efficient
                    algorithms and data structures and offers ample room for innovation and growth.

                    <u><b>Familiarize myself with Fortinet firewalls.</b></u> During
                    this term, I was exposed to firewalls for the first time. It was really interesting to
                    learn
                    about how firewalls work, and about their capabilities and features. In addition to completing
                    two Fortinet Cybersecurity certifications, I was also able to get a small unit at my desk to
                    test
                    my firewall diagnosis tool with.

            <h4>Conclusions</h4>
            <div class="d-flex flex-wrap justify-content-center align-items-center">
                <p>
                    <b>Note: </b>This report is intentionally high-level at Magna's request.<br><br>
                    This was my first technical work experience, and it was filled with
                    of learning, challenges, and fun!
                    <br><br>
                    I thoroughly enjoyed the work I did, and it further solidified my goal
                    of a career in technology.
                    However, whether it be as
                    a software developer, a cybersecurity anaylyst, or a machine learning
                    engineer, I'm still unsure.
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, I wanted to touch on the fact that I really feel like my
                    courses prepared me for the industry (especially CIS*2750). I was able to extrapolate from what
                    I'd done in my classes and apply my knowledge to define new problems, and develop
                    and implement solutions for them.<br><br>
